## Windy's Stockholders
The textbook that I was assigned to read, C# Nutshell, by Joseph Albahari, had a modified example that we focused on building on. Using the starting code from my Professor's GitHub. This project shows lists of stocks with different prices, there is the old and new price, that randomly changes over times. Then afterword, the system will spit out the changes information of the prices.

##### Questions: Were there a technical detail you think were good for this project?
One technical detail is the rondom number generator, located in public void PriceFlutuation(). What it does is by the name, automatically pulls numbers from the code and showcase it by another code.

##### More images incoming!
