This is my weather app! This project is about using my console responding to the XML, that their job is to load the current weather.

Some cool features are that my weather app was built in C#. The other feature is using API.

## Windy's Stockholders
The textbook that I was assigned to read, C# Nutshell, by Joseph Albahari, had a modified example that we focused on building on. Using the starting code from my Professor's GitHub. This project shows lists of stocks with different prices, there is the old and new price, that randomly changes over times. Then afterword, the system will spit out the changes information of the prices.

##### Questions: Were there a technical detail you think were good for this project?
One technical detail is the rondom number generator, located in public void PriceFlutuation(). What it does is by the name, automatically pulls numbers from the code and showcase it by another code.

##### More images incoming!

## Windy's CardGame
##### Questions: What is the game about? Can you give me a description?
Windy's Card Game contains 3 card games, it gives the players options to choose which game they can pick and play. Inside, there is Apple or Orange, Higher or Lower, and lastly, Highest Match. I will be mostly focusing on the card game, Apple or Orange. Apple or Orange is a game where the player will have to guess if the next card they are gonna draw will be the same or not. Which is what the image below is, the codes;

One C# feature of this game that is being used is the auto-properties, like the card and player classes. The auto-property helps with spitting out quick responses!

## Adventure_Game 
##### Question: Care to give me a description of your adventure game?
Sure. My adventure game isn't really your typical game; instead of a playing, talking to NCP game, it's more of an exploration game. You, still called the player, will choose and pick where locations, which hold a description and ideas of concepts in the games I have in mind. You would be able to view and click certain things for a small interaction.

The image on top is my start screen of my project; FUN FACT, I'm using a WPF application. 
NavigationFrame.Navigate(new Start()); is my method of ways of navigating through the screen.
